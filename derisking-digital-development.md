## Developing a Digital Therapeutic for Individuals With Co-occurring Substance Use and Mood Disorders

Dawn E Sugarman

#### Connected Health Innovation Challenge

### Problem

1. Struggle
1. Relapse
1. Detox (tech can help)
1. Inadequate treatment (tech can help)

### *Integrated Group Therapy for Bipolar Disorder and Substance Abuse* by Weiss and Connery

- Needs to be accessible
- Need to be in-the-moment support

### IGT Options

- Virtual coach
- Daily check-ins
- Group support
- Customized IGT skill training
- Progress tracking

### MVP

- Subset of features
- Partner: Pivot Labs (Partners HealthCare)

### Risks

- What is optimal engagement?
- Evidence based treatment to digital platform could lead to losses in translation
- Should there be, and how should clinitian involvement be handled
- Funding for build and maintenance?
- Security


## What to Push, When to Push It and How to Keep the Barnum Effect out of It

David Epstein, PhD, National Institute on Drug Abuse

### When to Push It: Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI)

Push/pull refer to content delivery (think "push notifications")

- Even with physiological view, it would be hard to be truly predictive
- Passive monitoring will not be as accurate as human interaction – Lisa Feldman Barrett
    - Differentiating types of arousal is difficult (e.g. angry, excited)
- Prediction is based on where the person *has been* not just *is*
- Specificity VS Sensitivity
    - VS Prevalence and Accuracy
    - ![sensitivity vs specificity](https://www.medcalc.org/manual/_help/images/roc_intro2.png)
- Predicition is most accurate if
    - Episodes are infrequent and large
- Prediction is harder than detection

### What to Push

- What content should go into a mobile intervention
    - What is a *teachable moment* and how do you capitalize on it?
    - What should a "clinician" do when not in the office? (When the clinician is the phone in your pocket)
- Trying to evaluate the *type of content* to include in intervention apps
    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy type messages

### Barnum Effect

The tendency for people to believe that a fortune cookie was really tailored to them

- "How Algorithmic Sensor Feedback Influences Emotion Perception" (some study)
    - Proves that feedback frames affect personal judgement

### Take Away

1. Time scale of prediction (or just detection)
1. Is it "momentary" content?
1. Does your algorithm beat a placebo?


## Development and Evaluation of a Novel Digital Therapeutic

Lisa Marsch, PhD, Dartmouth University

- [Pear Therapeutics](https://peartherapeutics.com/products/pearconnect/) – "Clinician in your pocket"
- > Digital therapeutic is as effective as "Gold Standard" clinician-delivered treatment in medication-assisted treatment for OUD (Bickel, Marsch et al., 2008)
    - Per cycle: 5 sessions with digital, 1 with clinician was equivalent to 6 sessions from clinician
- Opioid Abstinent (Marsch et al., 2014)
    - "Web with reduced treatment as usual" outperformed treatment as usual
- Treatment retention
- FDA authorized first "Digital Therapeutic" (reSET)tm Based on Data from CTN Trial with TEST – 09/2017

### Medical Device

> - "an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is:
>   - recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them,
>   - intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or
>   - intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and

### Protect, Advance, Access

- FDA is working on "Digital Health Pre-Certification" to meet the speed of product updates (specifically for software medical devices)
- FDA Regulating a *product developer*, not just a product
