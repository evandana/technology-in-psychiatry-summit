## Developing a Digital Therapeutic for Individuals With Co-occurring Substance Use and Mood Disorders

Dawn E Sugarman

#### Connected Health Innovation Challenge

### Problem

1. Struggle
1. Relapse
1. Detox (tech can help)
1. Inadequate treatment (tech can help)

### *Integrated Group Therapy for Bipolar Disorder and Substance Abuse* by Weiss and Connery

- Needs to be accessible
- Need to be in-the-moment support

### IGT Options

- Virtual coach
- Daily check-ins
- Group support
- Customized IGT skill training
- Progress tracking

### MVP

- Subset of features
- Partner: Pivot Labs (Partners HealthCare)

### Risks

- What is optimal engagement?
- Evidence based treatment to digital platform could lead to losses in translation
- Should there be, and how should clinitian involvement be handled
- Funding for build and maintenance?
- Security


## What to Push, When to Push It and How to Keep the Barnum Effect out of It

David Epstein, PhD, National Institute on Drug Abuse

### When to Push It: Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI)

Push/pull refer to content delivery (think "push notifications")

- Even with physiological view, it would be hard to be truly predictive
- Passive monitoring will not be as accurate as human interaction – Lisa Feldman Barrett
    - Differentiating types of arousal is difficult (e.g. angry, excited)
- Prediction is based on where the person *has been* not just *is*
- Specificity VS Sensitivity
    - VS Prevalence and Accuracy
    - ![sensitivity vs specificity](https://www.medcalc.org/manual/_help/images/roc_intro2.png)
- Predicition is most accurate if
    - Episodes are infrequent and large
- Prediction is harder than detection

### What to Push

- What content should go into a mobile intervention
    - What is a *teachable moment* and how do you capitalize on it?
    - What should a "clinician" do when not in the office? (When the clinician is the phone in your pocket)
- Trying to evaluate the *type of content* to include in intervention apps
    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy type messages

### Barnum Effect

The tendency for people to believe that a fortune cookie was really tailored to them

- "How Algorithmic Sensor Feedback Influences Emotion Perception" (some study)
    - Proves that feedback frames affect personal judgement

### Take Away

1. Time scale of prediction (or just detection)
1. Is it "momentary" content?
1. Does your algorithm beat a placebo?
