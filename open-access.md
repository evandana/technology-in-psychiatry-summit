### Digital Mental Health Deployment

- Self help vs Digital mental health tools
- Coach or human improves outcomes and engagement (even if not a mental health professional)

### Main Problems with Mental Health

1. Failure to design for the patient
    - Most have tried mental health app but abandoned quickly
    - Don't want:
        - Behavior tracking
        - Social media
    - Apps used for singular purposes
1. Failure to design for the care system

### App Examples

- Day to Day
- Thought Challenger

### Metrics to Gather

- Interactions
    - Messages
    - App launches
- Downloads

### Designing for Care Management

- Service protocol
- Technology
- Implementation plan

### From Psychotherapy to Digital Mental Health

- Skeuomorph: a derivative object that retains design cues that were necessary in the original
    - Example: save icon is an obsolete disk


## Kamal Jethwani, MD MPH (Partners HealthCare and Harvard Medical School)

- Investment in mental health is increasing

### Virtual Solutions

1. Virtual Visits
1. eVisits (email/evisit platform)
1. Virtual Consults (doctor to doctor)
1. eConsults (doctor to doctor)

### Apps

- AI support
- Peer support
- Muse or Spire
    - Monitor respitory rate and alert if "stressed"


## Vikram Patel
