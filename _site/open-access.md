### Digital Mental Health Deployment

- Self help vs Digital mental health tools
- Coach or human improves outcomes and engagement (even if not a mental health professional)

### Main Problems with Mental Health

1. Failure to design for the patient
    - Most have tried mental health app but abandoned quickly
    - Don't want:
        - Behavior tracking
        - Social media
    - Apps used for singular purposes
1. Failure to design for the care system

### App Examples

### Designing for Care Management

- Service protocol
- Technology

### From Psychotherapy to Digital Mental Health

- Skeuomorph: a derivative object that retains design cues that were necessary in the original
    - Example: save icon is an obsolete disk
